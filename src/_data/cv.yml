          In 2009, we created a site for readers to upload and share their photos from the
          inauguration of President Obama. Built on this prototype to create a tool in Ruby on
          Rails called PUFFY (for Photo Upload Form For You) that allowed editors to moderate
          reader-submitted photos in 30+ projects. For one of these named "A Moment in Time," more
          than 10,000 readers submitted geotagged photos taken at the same time across the Earth.

          fed stories from RSS feeds into 80+ Twitter accounts associated at the Times. Ran
          operations for social media for several years before handing off to the new social media
          team at the NYT.
