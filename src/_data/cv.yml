objective: >
  I am seeking a full-time position as a Tech Lead/Manager of Software Engineering. With 27 years of
  software engineering experience – 16 years of those in senior technical leadership and 7 in
  engineering management – I excel at creating web applications, APIs or other backend services
  right-sized for the problem and the organization. I have extensive experience with multiple
  programming languages, and I am quick to learn new skills on a project and leverage my software
  architecture skills to design straightforward solutions. I have over a decade of experience in
  agile software development. Building software is a team effort and I boost team velocity through
  clear technical direction and effective communication with stakeholders. I also am an empathetic
  people manager, who enjoys mentoring people and guiding them as they advance in their careers.
career:
- company: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
  link: http://www.consumerfinance.gov/
  title: Supervisory IT Specialist
  start: 2023
  end: now&nbsp;
  description: >-
    The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a small federal agency founded in 2010 and
    dedicated to financial education, regulation and enforcement. It was the first civic technology
    team anywhere.
  projects:
  - title: Application Development Lead in Design & Development
    description: >-
      The Design & Development (D&D) team within CFPB handles a variety of print and digital design,
      as well as software development responsibilities. As part of the Front Office leadership team,
      I am responsible for supervisory managerial duties within the department while over partially
      overseeing the technical work for multiple front-end and back-end web developers. In this
      capacity, I guide decision-making, steer teams through bureaucratic roadblocks and establish
      core practices for the entire engineering team.
  - title: Supervisory IT Specialist
    description: >-
      I am the first-line supervisor for 12 software engineers distributed in a matrix model across
      5 different software engineering teams. These teams work on the CFPB website, consumer-facing
      tools, internal enforcement products and consumer complaints. As their supervisor, I conduct
      regular 1-1s with all my direct reports, coach them through problems and assess their
      performance against agency expectations twice a year. I take particular pride in having
      re-established regular engineering syncs as well as sending staff to conferences and other
      training opportunities.
  - title: Contracting Officer Representative (Level 1)
    description: >-
      I am certified as a COR Level 1 in the federal government and have overseen the the
      procurement, payment and even the wind-down of several Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) products
      used by developers within Design & Development. In my role as COR, I have also helped to roll
      out Single-Sign-On (SSO) support for multiple applications as well as set up necessary
      configuration.
- company: Nava PBC
  link: https://www.navapbc.com/
  title: Senior Engineering Lead / Engineering Manager
  start: 2018
  end: 2023
  description: >
    Nava is a public benefit corporation that contracts with both federal and state government
    agencies to build solutions and thoughtfully apply technology to serve the American public.
  projects:
  - title: Medicare Replicated Data Access (RDA) API
    link: https://www.usds.gov/projects/medicare-payment-program
    description: >-
      The Medicare Payment Systems Modernization (MPSM) is an ambitious long-term effort spanning
      multiple teams to migrate Medicare payments processing away from COBOL running on mainframes
      to modern Java running in the AWS Cloud. I was the Engineering Lead (a key personnel role) of
      the Replicated Data Access (RDA) API team, which built a GRPC API to cheaply stream millions
      of claims in near real-time to other teams within CMS. I also helped guide the expansion of
      the RDA API contracti itself to increase Nava's responsibility for claims streaming, as well
      as a pilot project to receive data in the FHIR format.
  - title: CMS Cloud IT Operations (CLOUDITOPS)
    description: >-
      The CMS Cloud ITOPS project modernized the infrastructure to migrate hundreds of applications
      at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to the AWS and Microsoft Azure clouds.
      As a developer on the Apps team, I helped to identify and implement ways to operationalize
      some custom tooling needed for security and compliance. I also built new tooling in Go to
      address gaps in existing technology, and I implemented infrastructure as code (IaC) in
      Terraform. I also served as a people manager for 6 engineers.
  - title: Quality Payments Program (QPP) Submissions API
    link: https://qpp.cms.gov/developers
    description: >-
      The QPP program in Medicare updates the flat fee-for-service model of Medicare to use adjusted
      reimbursements that reward effective doctors who improve the quality of Medicare. Nava built
      the QPP Submissions API in Express and Node.js to accept annual submissions of measures by
      participating health registries. I joined this team while the API was already in service, but
      I designed the initial version of the final scoring algorithm and helped with a larger effort
      to improve the scoring process for future years. After several months on the team, I then
      moved into the role of Senior Tech Lead (key personnel) for the project, managing a team of up
      to 9 engineers following agile practices and coordinating our work with other contractors
      working on the 14 teams implementing the QPP project. When Nava's involvement ended on this
      contract, I helped gracefully wind down and hand off the work to our successors.
  - title: Business Development Work
    description: >-
      I participated on multiple teams crafting bids and implementing technical challenges to expand
      Nava's reach into new areas. On these projects, I worked closely with my colleagues to
      research architectures of current systems and define our proposed approach to the problems.
      This included architecture digagrams, staffing and cost estimates, QASPs and other measures of
      success as well as our proposed timelines and milestones.
  - title: Engineering Management
    description: >-
      I began as an Engineering Manager at Nava in the fall of 2018. For most of my time at Nava, I
      typically managed teams of 6-8 engineers and coached their career development through weekly
      1:1s and regular performance checkins. I am most proud about guiding multiple junior engineers
      to increase their skills and responsibilities and earn promotions into senior engineers. I
      consistently received accolades about my management approach in 360 Reviews, with specific
      recognition for building supportive teams and addressing problems quickly for my engineers to
      be productive.
- company: 18F
  link: https://18f.org/
  title: Innovation Specialist
  start: 2015
  end: 2018
  description: >
    18F was a “government startup” that operates within the General Services Administration and
    consults to build software products for other federal agencies as clients. We built all of our
    projects in public, as open source software informed by user research and agile planning.
  projects:
  - title: MyUSA
    link: https://github.com/18F/myusa
    description: >-
      I joined this project upon starting at 18F and helped build out the backend and user
      interface. A precursor to login.gov, MyUSA was a prototype web application for the public to
      use single-sign-on to and control what information they shared with various government
      websites.
  - title: Micro-purchase
    link: https://micropurchase.18f.gov
    description: >-
      "The premise of the micro-purchase experiment was radical: government employees should be able
      to commission custom software development with the same ease as they can buy office supplies.
      The initial experiment was built in Google Docs; I helped create a robust web application in
      Ruby on Rails to successfully run all other auctions."
  - title: FBI Crime Data Explorer
    link: https://github.com/18F/crime-data-api
    description: >-
      I am extremely interested in Open Data; when I learned that 18F would be building a new web
      application interface for crime data from the FBI, I requested to be part of that roject,
      especially since it would allow me to learn Python too. I worked closely with another senior
      developer to build and optimize an API used by the visual explorer website. I also created
      data loading queries to build new crosstab analyses of crime data that took advantage of the
      new NIBRS reporting data.
  - title: Confidential Survey
    link: https://github.com/18f/confidential-survey
    description: >-
      As part of my involvement with the Diversity Guild, I built a prototype for conducting surveys
      without collecting individual records that could compromise a user's privacy.
- company: The New York Times
  link: http://nytimes.com
  title: Senior Software Architect
  office: Interactive News
  start: 2006
  end: 2015
  description: >-
    In 2007, I was a co-founder of the Interactive Newsroom Technologies Team, a startup-like group
    embedded within the newsroom that creates news-driven web applications on agile timeframes. Some
    of the more notable projects that I worked on are listed below.
  projects:
  - title: Elections (2008-2014)
    link: /projects/nytimes-election-loader.html
    description: >-
      In 2008, I paired with another developer to build a new and better election results loader for
      the general election. We continued using it for both primaries and general elections from 2008
      to 2014, as well as for the NYC mayoral election in 2013. Duing this time, I refactored that
      loader into a modular API-based service that shared results with the web and print and
      operated under insane amounts of traffic.
  - title: Olympics Results (2010/2012)
    link: http://2010games.nytimes.com/events/curling/mens/results.html
    description: >
      To improve how the _Times_ presented Olympics results, in 2010 I helped architect and build a
      backend service that could parse a firehose of XML data provided by the International Olympic
      Committee to populate pages, visualizations and interactive widgets for both the web and
      print. I also helped to architect the successor system built for the 2012 London Olympics.
  - title: Wikileaks War Logs
    link: /projects/wikileaks-war-logs.html
    description: >
      When Wikileaks provided the _Times_ with leaked military dispatches from Iraq and Afghanistan,
      I built an internal web application used by reporters to search and analyze the people and
      places within. I also contributed research and pitched a graphic to accompany a story about a
      surge of sectarian violence in Baghdad after the US invasion.
  - title: PUFFY
    link: https://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/readers-13/
    description: >-
      In 2009, we created a site for readers to upload and share their photos from the inauguration
      of President Obama. This became the basis of a general-purpose tool named PUFFY (for Photo
      Upload Form For You) that allowed editors to moderate reader-submitted photos in 30+ projects.
      For one of these named "A Moment in Time," more than 10,000 readers submitted geotagged photos
      taken at the same time across the Earth.
  - title: Open Source
    link: https://open.nytimes.com/
    description: >-
      As a senior software architect in NYT Digital, I spearheaded new open-source initiatives at
      the NYT and improved outreach for people to use public APIs from the New York Times. I also
      helped to create the open.blogs.nytimes.com site for engineers to blog about their work at the
      Times.
  - title: "@nytimes Twitter Account"
    link: /projects/nytimes-twitter.html
    description: >
      One afternoon in 2007, I created the @nytimes twitter account to explore automated news feeds.
      I built a custom posting bot and admin interface for feeding stories from various RSS feeds
      into the 80+ accounts belonging to the _Times_.
  - title: Times Haiku
    link: /projects/times-haiku.html
    description: >
      After the 2012 election, I built a bot that scanned _Times_ articles to find haiku embedded
      within them. This became a Tumblr blog of curated haiku that ran from 2013 to 2017, posting
      thousands of found haiku.
- company: Alacra, Inc.
  title: Software Developer

  description: >
    Alacra resells financial content from over 80 different databases to financial and legal firms.
    My role there was R&D and rapid development, particularly in projects that combined content from
    multiple databases. I also built a custom web crawler, XML parser and services framework using
    XML and XSLT.
