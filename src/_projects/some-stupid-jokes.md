These are some stupid jokes I have told repeatedly online over the years. None of them are particularly good, but they are very much mine. And I figured I'd record them here for posterity...

### Jakecoin

Jakecoin is the ultimate cryptocurrency. Jakecoin is easy to acquire! Jakecoin can be easily subdivided into multiple pieces called "slices." Jakecoin can stop scurvy. Jakecoin are actually Clementine Oranges.

### Summer Kerning

_**Remember that Memorial Day is when the New York Times switches to a looser, more breathable "summer kerning" for the season.**_ On Labor Day, I then joke about them moving back to regular kerning. I've posted this every summer since 2011. That's it. That's the joke.

### The People's History of Tatooine

Probably one of my favorite things that happened on Twitter is when a quick joke about Star Wars (_**What if Mos Eisley wasn't really that wretched and it was just Obi Wan being racist again?**_) turned into a multi-hour long riffing on the idea among friends. Really this was the best thing about Twitter back in the day before it got turned into a cesspit. Thankfully, [Kottke captured all the tweets in a single document](https://kottke.org/17/12/the-peoples-history-of-tattooine).

### Havre de Grace tweets

Finally, this one isn't much of a joke, but it was a tradition for a while. When I moved down to DC in 2012, I still found myself commuting up to New York City regularly by train for [election night reporting]({% link _projects/nytimes-election-loader.md %}). I found myself in the habit of posting "Havre de Grace" (sometimes with a photograph) when Amtrak was near the town of the same name on the Maryland shore, starting in 2013. Soon, other journalists started doing it too. It became a thing for a little bit for us to mark our various work trips.
