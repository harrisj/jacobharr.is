title: Sky Gradients
descriptions: From 2015-2024, I often found myself looking at the sky to capture an image of a sky gradient and post it to Instagram. This archive collects all the gradients for users to browse without needing Instagram.

One of my personal little hobbies has been to take a photo of the clear blue sky and post it to Instagram with no other context or explanation. I find it soothing, but I have fallen out of using it since I no longer use Instagram. So, I decided to instead collect all of the images here! Click on any image to view it in its original size and scale. All images are in the public domain [Creative Commons Zero](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/); it's the sky, I don't own it!

I also wrote an article in _The Atlantic_ [explaining the whole thing with some possible artistic antecedents]({% post_url published/2016-03-04-instagram-sky %}) as well. There also is a [zip archive](/images/projects/sky-gradients.zip) (8.2MB) if you want to use them for your own projects. If you make something cool, please let me know!
